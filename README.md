CODSOFT Java Development Internship
<BR>
Welcome to my CODSOFT Java Development Internship repository! This repository contains the solutions to the tasks assigned during my internship at CodSoft. Each task demonstrates my understanding of core Java concepts and problem-solving skills.

About the Internship
CodSoft provided an opportunity to work on real-world Java programming tasks, helping me enhance my coding skills and gain hands-on experience. The tasks covered a variety of topics, including basic programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and user interface design.

Tasks Completed
Below are the tasks I completed during the internship:

1. Number Game
Description: A simple number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range.

File:NumberGame.java

Features:

Random number generation.

User feedback (too high, too low, correct guess).

Multiple rounds and score tracking.

2. Student Grade Calculator
Description: A program to calculate a student's total marks, average percentage, and grade based on marks obtained in multiple subjects.

File: StudentGradeCalculator.java

Features:

Input validation for marks.

Grade calculation based on average percentage.

Display of results in a user-friendly format.

3. ATM Interface
Description: A console-based ATM interface that allows users to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw money.

File: ATM.java

Features:

Object-oriented design with BankAccount class.

User-friendly menu-driven interface.

Input validation for transactions.

4. Currency Converter
Description: A program to convert an amount from one currency to another using mock exchange rates.

File: CurrencyConverter.java

Features:

Currency selection (base and target).

Mock exchange rates (can be replaced with real-time API data).

Display of converted amount.

5. Student Management System
Description: A console-based application to manage student records, including adding, removing, searching, and displaying students.

File: StudentManagementSystemApp.java

Features:

Object-oriented design with Student and StudentManagementSystem classes.

Menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Input validation for student data.

How to Use the Code
Clone the Repository:

bash
